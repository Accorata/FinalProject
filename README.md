# FinalProject

Compile and Run Instructions:

Runs in Processing and there are no other dependencies.

Keyboard Controls:
"wasd" -> Move forwards/left/backwards/right respectively
"ijkl" -> Look up/left/down/right respectively
"p" (Pause) -> Toggle enemy movement
"t" when mouse is in center of the screen -> Toggle mouse control (Allows screen to be rotated by the mouse)
"123" -> Swap to gun 1/2/3 respectively
"r" -> Reloads current gun
Click -> Shoots current gun
"q" -> Toggles whether the triangle outlines are visible

5/23 Henry - Created a basic framework for displaying objects and started rotations.
5/26 Henry - Started more intuitive movement controls.
5/27 Henry - Added jump features and expanded upon movement controls.
5/28 Henry - Build a rectangular prism class.
5/29 Henry - Created the system for how rotating the camera will work.
5/30 Henry - Created code that makes objects built out a lot of smaller triangles.
5/30 + 6/1 Henry - Fixed some bugs and reworked some functions.
6/2 Henry - Built the sphere, pyramid, and triangular prism classes.
6/6 Henry - Created basis vectors that would be used for object movement and created a system that reduced the points used to calculate the centers of objects to reduce lag.
6/7 Henry - Created inverse basis vectors to allow objects to be translated into more usable coordinates, fixed a large bug that contributed, turned enemies into ellipses, and started enemy movement AI.
6/8 Henry - Created the legs for the enemy and expanded the lag reducing idea into enemy ellipses and spheres in general.
6/10 Henry - Enemies legs now move as they would in real life, the enemy has a better color design and an eye that shows where it heads, they walk in the direction they face, and they track you (although this sometimes bugs).
6/11 Henry - Enemy legs now move in the direction they are walking not just into themselves and they finally always walk right towards the player when they see them.
6/12 Henry - Reworked the breachable system, applied it to the enemies to program them a better AI and not allow them to walk through walls, applied it to bullets to cause them to go away when hitting other objects and actually deal damage to enemies and/or the player.
6/13 Henry - Created final world map, fixed some bugs, and put the gameplay instructions in the readme.

5/23 Raymond - Fixed some bugs with Henry, worked on preliminary viewing algorithm.
5/24 Raymond - Researched basic game design
5/25-5/26 Raymond - Coded rotation on the 3 axises
5/27 Raymond - Coded a working camera to view objects
5/28 Raymond - Built standardized object classes
5/29 Raymond - Created the system for how rotating and translating the camera will work.
5/30 Raymond - Worked on light
6/1 Raymond - Worked on refined FPS like movement
6/2 Raymond - Gun glass and enemy framework
6/3 Raymond - Worked on shooting from players point of view
6/4 Raymond - Created a hitscan system for enemies to take damage;
6/8 Raymond - Bug fixing and refined shooting/movemnt
6/10 Raymond - More bug fixing and structure building
6/11 Raymond - Projectile motion for bullets;
6/12 Raymond - Created game logic for play


THE SAME NEW WORLD:

Games have been evolving since the beginning of human history. Games used to be simple physical or mental games played with a couple of people. This then evolved into various board games, card games, sports, etc. With the invention of computers and other technologies, the evolution of games took another giant leap in history. This era of computer games started with basic 2d logic games like Pac-man or Tetris but has vastly grown since then. Now, virtually every game on the market is in 3d and some are even in 4d. Our project aims to bring the user into the third dimension by utilizing some of the most basic 3d principles. THE SAME NEW WORLD is a basic 3d first-person shooter(FPS) where each player can experience a much simpler model of some of the most popular games on the market today.
