THE SAME NEW WORLD:

Games have been evolving since the beginning of human history. Games used to be simple physical or mental games played with a couple of people. This then evolved into various board games, card games, sports, etc. With the invention of computers and other technologies, the evolution of games took another giant leap in history. This era of computer games started with basic 2d logic games like Pac-man or Tetris but has vastly grown since then. Now, virtually every game on the market is in 3d and some are even in 4d. Our project aims to bring the user into the third dimension by utilizing some of the most basic 3d principles. THE SAME NEW WORLD is a basic 3d first-person shooter(FPS) where each player can experience a much simpler model of some of the most popular games on the market today.
